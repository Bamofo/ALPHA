		<description>This is the base level of timing during non-cruise conditions. Cruise and non-cruise conditions are determined by a number of factors including engine speed, requested torque, MAF, vehicle speed, IAT, idle mode, ECT, and SI-Drive mode (if applicable). The ECU will ramp between the cruise and non-cruise map values when conditions dictate the switch. The actual base timing is also determined by the 'Base Timing Reference Non-Cruise (AVCS related)' table. During a period after initial start (related to AVCS warm-up and other factors), the ECU will calculate Base Timing as primary - min0(primary - reference), with min0 being a function limiting the (primary - reference) result to zero. If you do not want the base timing to follow this behavior, set the primary and reference maps to the same values (separated by cruise/non-cruise).Total timing = base timing + knock correction advance + other timing compensations. Knock correction advance = (knock correction advance max map value * current advance multiplier) + feedback knock correction + fine knock correction.</description>
